# Car Operations Simplification Project

## Overview

This project uses the Facade design pattern to simplify interactions with different types of cars. The Facade pattern provides a unified and easy-to-use interface that allows operating cars of various brands (Ford, Toyota, and Honda) without needing to know the technical details of each one.

## Objective

The main objective is to enhance the user experience when interacting with the system, making operations more intuitive and accessible, even for those without technical knowledge.

## Benefits

- **Ease of Use:** A single interface to operate different cars.
- **Abstraction of Complexity:** Users do not need to know the internal details of each car.
- **Improved User Experience:** More intuitive and accessible interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Simplified Interface:** A Facade class is created to act as an intermediary between the user and the car classes.
2. **Unified Operations:** The Facade class provides methods to operate each type of car in a straightforward manner.
3. **Intuitive Interaction:** Users can operate the cars by calling simple methods without worrying about internal details.

This approach makes the system easier to use and significantly improves the user experience.
